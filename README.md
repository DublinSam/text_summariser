### Text Summariser

This repo contains the code for my implementation of a text summariser based on the TextRank algorithm described in [this](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) 2004 paper by *Mihalcea and Tarau*.

It contains modules for summarising text at both the keyword and sentence level.  To run the tool, simply enter:

    python3 keyword_extractor.py

or 

    python3 sentence_extractor.py
